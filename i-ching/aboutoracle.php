<h3>The Oracle</h3>

<p>The phenomenon of the oracle seems to be older than organized religion. The Chinese I Ching is one of the oldest books known, over 4,000 years old, and predates the Jewish Bible.</p>

<p>Accounts of the Oracle in western literature are also old, though, and occur in various places in books of the Old Testament. For example, in the Book of Esther Haman "cast lots" to decide when to attack the Jews. The Jewish victory over Haman is now celebrated as Purim.</p>

<p>During the Intertestamental period, Roman documents called the Cybeline Oracle were recorded. These were prophecies given by special women on the future of the state. In later Christian times these were re-interpreted so as to give a sense of Christian prophecy.</p>

<p>The oracle was usually pronounced after a sensitive  went into trance state, or after interpreting some randmized event like the tossing of a coin, or sticks, or reading the cracks produced on a tortoise shell roasting over a fire. Sometimes the Oracle was achieved by more gruesome means.</p>

<p>In Arabia there was a black magic which was produced by pickling a virgin boy in a barrel of oil, then popping off his head and cooking it in a fire. According to the testimony, the head would then speak the sorceror's fortune.</p>

<h3>Is it real?</h3>

<p>Our oracle can best be understood as a psychological reality, but no less valid than the physical reality people struggle to live inside during the span of our relatively short lives. Yet, the cumulative growth of the human species extends far in both directions, past and future, and even into unseen directions, universes dimly grasped by the mind, and into heavenly realms, or infernal.</p>

<p>Decisions made in your own life ripple through civilization as a whole. Was a rock thrown in anger, or did a pigeon knock it off a tall building? What decision was made, whose problems compound through ignorance?</p>

<p>In the Charles Schneer/Ray Harryhausen film "Jason and the Argonauts" King Pelias consults an oracle to find out if Zeus favors his military coup. The oracle is none other than the messenger god Hermes in disguise. Hermes gives accurate pronouncement of the outcome of Pelias's ambition, but King Pelias only listens with half an ear, and so loses more than he had gained.</p>


<p><h3>How to use</h3>
Rather than thinking of our oracle as a fortune telling machine, regard the answer it gives with contemplation about the state of your inner world. Go beyond yourself, beyond "am I going to make money," or, "does he love me." For instance, the last question, "Does he love me?" might be a question with ripples across the cosmos. "Does he love me?" "Does God love me?" "Do I love myself?" "What is love?" "Can life exist without him?" What might be happening in the heavens, between two angels, perhaps, or what might be happening between some man and woman in far-off Turkey or a hidden jungle in Polynesia? Did the dollar you earn today take away from somebody who needed it more than you did? When you forsook the dollar of today, did you come by a greater treasure instead?</p>

<p>Cast the oracle once, then give the answer some though throughout the day, until its deeper meaning hits you in the head like that rock knocked off the roof by the pigeon. After all, that pigeon could very well be a god or angel in disguise.</p>
