RT: was a javascript-based chat widget, originally written for a client who has since removed their web site. It was also a .NET SOAP consumer, relying on an MS SQL database that no longer exists. The code within this folder requested a login cookie, then displayed or didn't display a "talk" button, dependening upon if you were logged in or not. If you were logged in to the website, you could enter short messages. The client could define multiple channels, so the chat program would display messages according to channel.

I-CHING: This app is actually active on Facebook, as an entertainment app. It is a liberal interpretation of the well known Chinese "Book of Change", using the John Blofeld method of tossing pennies to obtain an oracle reading. It was my first AJAX project, which I wrote in 2006, and later adapted as a Facebook app.
A complete working example of I-CHING is available for inspection (and use) at this Facebook page:

WarpIt, like RT, was a widget which the client could plug into their Blogspot, Serendipity, WordPress, or any website. It's appearance was a simple 80 x 30 button, with the word "WarpIt!". When pressed, a pop-out div with a demographic form appeared. Filled out and submitted, your profile was then stored in an MS SQL database. WarpIt was a javascript/PHP process that consumed a custom library of .NET SOAP web services.

When the WarpIt widget was placed in websites all over the world, you could click it and it would open a pop-out div (not a pop up window) and see a list of 10 ranked articles by different authors sharing the demographics you specified in the signup form. This was a way of getting people to read articles by people that resembled their own demographic, on multiple dimensions.

If you "Warped" an article, it added weight to the article's reputation, and so the articles would rise or lower in the list accordingly.
